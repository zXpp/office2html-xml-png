For scoring segmentation, you run like this with the dpcost flag:

python der+dpcost+purity.py -r /path/to/referencelist/file -s /path/to/sysrttm/folder/ -dp

and for channel identification you run like this (with the purity flag - not sure if using this metrics but it's interested to see anyway):

python der+dpcost+purity.py -r /path/to/referencelist/file -s /path/to/sysrttm/folder/ -pu
